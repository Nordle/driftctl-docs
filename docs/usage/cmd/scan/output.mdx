title: Output Format
---

driftctl supports multiple kinds of output formats and by default uses the standard output (console).

## Console

Environment: `DCTL_OUTPUT`

### Usage

```shell
$ driftctl scan
$ driftctl scan --output console://
$ DCTL_OUTPUT=console:// driftctl scan
```

### Structure

```console
Found deleted resources:
  aws_s3_bucket:
    - driftctl-bucket-test-2
Found unmanaged resources:
  aws_s3_bucket:
    - driftctl-bucket-test-3
Found drifted resources:
  - driftctl-bucket-test-1 (aws_s3_bucket):
    ~ Versioning.0.Enabled: false => true
Found 3 resource(s)
 - 33% coverage
 - 1 covered by IaC
 - 1 not covered by IaC
 - 1 deleted on cloud provider
 - 1/1 drifted from IaC
```

## JSON

### Usage

```shell
$ driftctl scan --output json:///tmp/result.json # Will output results to /tmp/result.json
$ driftctl scan --output json://result.json # Will output results to ./result.json
$ driftctl scan --output json://stdout # Will output results in json to stdout directly
$ DCTL_OUTPUT=json://result.json driftctl scan
```

### Structure

```json

  summary: {
    total_resources: 3,
    total_drifted: 1,
    total_unmanaged: 1,
    total_deleted: 1,

  },
  managed: [
    // list of resources found in IaC and in sync with remote
    {
      id: "driftctl-bucket-test-1",
      type: "aws_s3_bucket",
    },
  ],
  unmanaged: [

    {
      id: "driftctl-bucket-test-3",
      type: "aws_s3_bucket",
    },
  ],
  deleted: [

    },
  ],
  differences: [

        type: "aws_s3_bucket",
      },
      changelog: [
        {
          type: "update", // Kind of change, could be one of update, create, delete
          path: [
            // Path of the change, sorted from root to leaf
            "Versioning",
            "0",
            "Enabled",
          ],
          from: false, // Mixed type
          to: true, // Mixed type
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  coverage: 33,
}
```

## Computed Fields

From Terraform documentation, a `computed` field is often used to represent values that are not user configurable or can not be known at time of `terraform plan` or `apply`.

Since those values are not known ahead of time from terraform point of view, it is obviously possible that the values displayed in a terraform state file are not up-to-date and may require a `terraform refresh`.

Thus, it could be possible that driftctl finds drifts that are considered false positives because of those outdated values.

We decided to output computed fields and to display a message at the end of the scan to remind you of this behavior.

```shell
Found drifted resources:
  - eipalloc-0e2894d8ea42851df (aws_eip):
    ~ AssociationId: "" => "eipassoc-0ee67e1ca759733a2" (computed)
    ~ Instance: "" => "i-004611704837fd09a" (computed)
    ~ NetworkInterface: "" => "eni-0a62972b0471447f6" (computed)
    ~ PrivateDns: <nil> => "ip-172-31-40-4.eu-west-3.compute.internal" (computed)
    ~ PrivateIp: "" => "172.31.40.4" (computed)
Found 1 resource(s)
 - 100% coverage
 - 1 covered by IaC
 - 0 not covered by IaC
 - 0 deleted on cloud provider
 - 1/1 drifted from IaC
You have diffs on computed fields, check the documentation for potential false positive drifts
